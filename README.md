Eye-tracking technology, which relies on an eye tracker to measure eye movements and positions, has played an increasingly significant role in psychology, marketing, and user interfaces. While eye trackers have existed for many years, their early use was primarily limited to laboratory experiments for studying human eye movements rather than serving as a direct control medium in human-computer interaction (HCI).

A decade ago, the high cost of eye trackers—around $30,000—made them impractical for real-world user-computer interfaces. However, advancements in technology have led to the development of better and more affordable gaze interaction components. As a result, several high-profile companies, such as Tobii (EyeX tracker), Gaze Point (GP3 tracker), and Eye Tribe (Eye Tribe Tracker), have introduced low-cost eye trackers. With these cost reductions, new applications integrating eye tracking in HCI have started to emerge.

Traditional user interfaces offer a high bandwidth of communication from computer to user through images, animations, videos, and other media capable of delivering large amounts of information rapidly. However, input mechanisms from users to computers remain relatively limited in comparison. HCI aims to enhance this communication by enabling more natural and convenient interaction methods.

Since the human eye is a primary sensory input medium—responsible for acquiring 80% to 90% of external world information—it holds significant potential for multimedia communication between users and computers. Eye movements, particularly in real-time, can serve as a crucial input method, especially for individuals with motor disabilities, such as those with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Research in eye-tracking technology for user-computer interaction focuses on integrating eye movements into multimedia communication, making interactions more natural and efficient.
